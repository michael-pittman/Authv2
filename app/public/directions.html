                <p class="lead">First, you’ll need to know the IP address of the PC running Remote Desktop that you want to connect to. The easiest way to do this is to fire up the Command Prompt and use the ipconfig command. In the results, look for the section detailing the network adapter connecting you to the Internet (in our example, it’s “Ethernet Adapter”). In that section, look for the IPv4 address. <br> <br>

                    Next, you’ll log into your router and locate the Port Forwarding section. Exactly where that is will depend on what router you’re using. In that section, forward TCP port 3389 to the IPv4 address you located previously. <br><br>

                    You now should be able to log into Remote Desktop over the internet by connecting to the public IP address your router exposes for your local network. <br> <br>

                    Remembering that IP address can be tough (especially if it changes), so you also may want to set up a dynamic DNS service so you can always connect with an easy-to-remember domain name. You may also want to set up a static IP address on the computer running the Remote Desktop server. This will ensure that the computer’s internal IP address won’t change—if it does, you’ll have to change your port forwarding configuration.</p>

                <h3>Ducks Given (Secure) <span class="entypo-down-open"></span></h3>
                <p class="lead">If you create a virtual private network (VPN), you won’t have to expose the Remote Desktop server directly to the Internet. Instead, when you’re away from home, you can connect to the VPN, and your computer will act like it’s part of the same local network as the computer at home, running the Remote Desktop server. This will allow you to access Remote Desktop and other services normally only exposed on your local network. <br> <br>

                    If you pay for the full version, we will cover a number of ways to set up your own home VPN server, including a way to create a VPN server in Windows without any extra software or services. <br> <br>

                    Setting up a VPN is by far the more secure option when it comes to making Remote Desktop accessible over the internet, and with the right tools, it’s pretty simple to achieve. It is not your only option, though.</p>
